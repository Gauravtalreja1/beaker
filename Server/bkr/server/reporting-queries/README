This directory contains SQL queries which can be used to extract useful 
statistics from Beaker's database directly, using an external reporting tool 
such as JasperReports.

These SQL queries are tested in bkr.inttest.server.test_reporting_queries to 
make sure there are no schema changes which unwittingly break the query or 
affect its accuracy.
