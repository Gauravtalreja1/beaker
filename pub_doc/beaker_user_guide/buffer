=== Jobs ===
==== Submitting a Job ====
Submitting a Job involves sending an XML file (that provides the details of the job including what tasks to run and what kind of machine to run them on, and is called a 'Job workflow') to the beaker server

1. To use the same Job workflow files that you would have with RHTS, you will need to submit them in the following manner
{{{ 
   [root@localhost root]$
   }}}

2. To use a Job workflow created for beaker, the convert flag is not needed
{{{ 
   [root@localhost root]$ bkr job-submit <job_file>
   }}}

==== Watching a Job ====
1. After submitting a Job it will show you the ID of the newly created Job. You can then use this ID to watch the progress of the Job
{{{
[root@localhost root]$ bkr job-watch J:<job id>
}}}

==== Cancelling a Job ====
1. If you wish to cancel a job you have created, you use the 'bkr job-cancel' command in the following manner
{{{
[root@localhost root]$ bkr job-cancel J:<job id>
}}}

=== Tasks ===

==== Adding a task ====
1. If you want to add a task you use the following command
{{{
[root@localhost root]$ bkr task-add <task package>
}}}

2. If you would like to see what tasks are available for a given distro, there is this command
{{{
[root@localhost root]$ bkr task-list <distro>
}}}
