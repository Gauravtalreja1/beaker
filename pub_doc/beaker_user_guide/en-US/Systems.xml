		Beaker provides an inventory of machines attached to lab controllers. Machines can be added, removed, have details changed, and be provisioned
		amongst other things

		<title>System Searching</title>
		<para>
		System searches are conducted by first clicking on one of the items of the <literal>System</literal> menu at the top of the page.
                The search types are as follows;
                  
		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					<literal>All</literal> will search through all machines listed in Beaker
				</para>
			</listitem>

			<listitem>
				<para>
					<literal>Available</literal> will search through only machines that the currently logged in user has permission to reserve
				</para>
			</listitem>

			<listitem>
				<para>
					<literal>Free</literal> will search through only machines that the currently logged in user has permission to reserve and are currently free

                <para>
                 The search panel has two modes; simple and advanced. The simple search is the default, and the default search is of the System names, using the 'contains' operator.
                 To toggle between the two search modes, press the <literal>Toggle Search</literal> link.
                </para>
                <para id="search_panel_advanced">
		 The advanced search panel is reasonably self explanitory. The first column(Table) is the attribute on which the search is being performed, the second(Operation) 
                 is the type of search, and the third(Value) is the actual value to search on. The operators change depending on what type of attribute is being searched.
                 <note><title>Wildcards</title><para> No operator provides explicit wildcards other than the <literal>is</literal> operation, which allows the <literal>*</literal> wildcard when searching an attribute which is a string.</para></note>
                </para>
                <para>
                The kind of data returned in the System search can be changed by adding/removing the result columns. To do this the <literal>Toggle Result Columns</literal> link is pressed
                and the columns checked/unchecked.
