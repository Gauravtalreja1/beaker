To have one or more <literal>Users</literal> grouped together, Beaker uses <literal>Groups</literal>.
Systems can belong to one or more Groups.

<title>Adding a Group</title>
<para>

Groups can only be created/edited by a User in the Admin Group. 
To add a new Group go to <guimenu>Admin</guimenu>-&gt;<guimenuitem>Groups</guimenuitem> and click the <literal>Add( + )</literal> link at the bottom left.
You'll then be prompted to enter a <literal>Display Name</literal> and a <literal>Group Name</literal>. The former is the name that users of Beaker will see, and the latter
is the name used internally. It's fine to have these names the same, or different.
