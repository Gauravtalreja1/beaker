			Beaker is an automated software testing application that allows users to create and manage customized 'tests'. A task is a script that performs a specific task (or multiple tasks) and presents these task results to the user. These tasks consist of code, data, meta data, shell scripts, hooks to other code, and additional packages (or dependencies). Beaker uses an interactive user environment that is composed of API libraries, template files, and various tools.
		</div><div class="para">
			Beaker is composed of several components, but the Beaker environment is what users employ to create and run the tests. Software developers may compose tests remotely, and then use Beaker to deploy the test scripts in a test lab environment, where they will ultimately run on a dedicated test host(s). The developer uses the command line to configure Beaker and the generated output data collects to the <span class="application"><strong>stdout</strong></span> stream. Beaker stores the generated output data into a repository which users can can view via the Beaker GUI application.
		</div><div class="para">
			Software developers can deploy their tests into several automatic testing environments. They can run the tests in a real lab environment. They can run tests on their development machine's fake chroot tree. They should run their tests in a typical test lab environment, since this allows for automatic test scheduling and advanced test results collection (on many different operating systems and architectures). Also, the test lab environment is more likely to detect, report, and catalog system errors. This guide describes how to compose tests in a Beaker test lab environment.
		</div><div class="para">
			After developers create a new test, they can package it as a typical RPM file and submit it to the repository, where other users may download it. The Beaker file organization is very flexible, and this allows them to create highly complex tests. This flexibility allows developers to include more shell scripts, source code, or data files into their tests.
