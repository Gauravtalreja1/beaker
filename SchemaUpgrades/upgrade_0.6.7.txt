Update all existing FQDNs to lowercase
--------------------------------------

Run the following SQL statement (expected run time <5sec):

    UPDATE system SET fqdn = LOWER(fqdn);


Populate the reservation table
------------------------------

After running beaker-init to create the reservation table, populate it with 
historical data using this SQL statement (expected run time approx. 15 mins):

    INSERT INTO reservation (system_id, user_id, start_time, finish_time, type)
    SELECT
        system_id,
        user_id,
        created AS start_time,
        (SELECT MIN(created)
         FROM activity
         INNER JOIN system_activity ON activity.id = system_activity.id
         WHERE system_id = outer_system_activity.system_id
               AND ((created >= outer_activity.created AND action = 'Returned')
                    OR (created > outer_activity.created AND action = 'Reserved'))
        ) AS finish_time,
        CASE service
            WHEN 'Scheduler' THEN 'recipe'
            ELSE 'manual'
        END AS type
    FROM activity outer_activity
    INNER JOIN system_activity outer_system_activity ON outer_activity.id = outer_system_activity.id
    WHERE action = 'Reserved'
    GROUP BY start_time;

As apache user, run the sanity checking script provided in this directory, to 
verify that the reservation table has been populated correctly (expected run 
time approx. 2 mins):

    su -s /bin/sh -c 'python /usr/share/doc/beaker-server-0.6.7/upgrade_0.6.7_check_reservations.py' apache

If the script produces any errors, seek advice from a Beaker developer.
