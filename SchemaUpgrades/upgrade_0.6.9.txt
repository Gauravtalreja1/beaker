Make system.owner_id not NULLable
---------------------------------

First verify that there are no systems without an owner:

    SELECT * FROM system WHERE owner_id IS NULL;

If there are any, assign them to an owner before proceeding. For example, to 
assign all unowned systems to the admin user:

    UPDATE system
    SET owner_id = (SELECT user_id FROM tg_user WHERE user_name = 'admin')
    WHERE owner_id IS NULL;

Make the system.owner_id column not NULLable:

    ALTER TABLE system MODIFY owner_id INT NOT NULL;

To roll back:

    ALTER TABLE system MODIFY owner_id INT NULL;
