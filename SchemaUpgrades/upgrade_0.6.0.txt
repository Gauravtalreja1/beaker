Clean up orphaned recipe_task rows and prevent them from recurring:

DELETE FROM recipe_task_param WHERE recipe_task_id IN
    (SELECT id FROM recipe_task WHERE recipe_id IS NULL);
DELETE FROM recipe_task WHERE recipe_id IS NULL;
ALTER TABLE recipe_task
    MODIFY recipe_id INT NOT NULL,
    MODIFY task_id INT NOT NULL;
