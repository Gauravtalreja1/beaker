Add the following directive to /etc/httpd/conf.d/beaker-server.conf:

  Alias /bkr/apidoc /usr/share/bkr/server/apidoc/html

Update the <Location> section for authentication in 
/etc/httpd/conf.d/beaker-server.conf as follows. If this section is commented 
out or not present (i.e. if authentication is not handled by Apache) then this 
update can be ignored.

Change:
  <Location ~ "\/(login|mine|available|free|labcontrollers|usersystems|groups|powertypes|keytypes)">

to:
  <Location /bkr/login>

Remember to adjust the /bkr/ prefix as appropriate for the local installation.
