Beaker User Guide
=================

Beaker is the name for an automated testing framework proposed for
Fedora. It allows you to:

-  Build tasks.

-  Run tasks on remote systems.

-  Run tasks on multiple systems and system variations (i.e arch,
   operating system, memory size etc).

-  Store and display test results in a central location.

-  Manage an inventory of systems for running tests on.

Beaker enables users to create any task they would like (from testing
changes to kernel memory management to installing their favourite OS and
game server) and run these tasks on any number of machines of any
specification located anywhere in the world, and provide a simple
interface from where they can review the outcome of these tasks.
