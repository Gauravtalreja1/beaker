Theming the web interface
=========================

Administrators can apply custom styles and markup to Beaker's web interface. 
For example, you can make it match a common look-and-feel for your 
organization, or add extra links to site-specific resources.

See :doc:`../../admin-guide/theming` for details about how to use this feature.
