Reserve Workflow offers Prototype systems
=========================================

When you use the Reserve Workflow to pick a specific system to reserve, the 
list will now include systems with the type of "Prototype" or "Resource". 
Previously the list was limited to systems of type "Machine".

Note that when using the Reserve Workflow with its option to pick any system, 
the scheduler will only select systems of type "Machine". This behaviour is 
unchanged.
