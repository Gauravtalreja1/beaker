Changes in accessing "Removed" Systems
--------------------------------------

Systems which have been removed will only be accessible from a new
page (``Systems -> Removed``). Removed systems will no longer show up
in any system search elsewhere. Before this change, removed systems
matching a search criteria would also be listed along with other
matching systems.

The ``System/Status`` search column is not available on the
``Systems -> Removed`` page. On the other pages, ``Removed`` has been
removed from the values that can be searched on.

A new option ``--removed`` has also been added to the ``bkr
list-systems`` command.
