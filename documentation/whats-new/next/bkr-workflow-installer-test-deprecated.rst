bkr workflow-installer-test is deprecated
=========================================

Use the :option:`--kickstart <bkr --kickstart>` option for :program:`bkr 
workflow-simple` (or any other workflow command) instead. This option lets you 
pass a kickstart template which is rendered on the server using Beaker's 
existing kickstart templating mechanisms, which are now fully documented (see 
:ref:`custom-kickstarts`).
