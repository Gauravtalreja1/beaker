Command line support for removing accounts
------------------------------------------

A new subcommand ``remove-account`` has been added to the Beaker
command line client which allows Beaker admins to remove user
accounts.

For example, to remove the user accounts with usernames user1 and
user2::

    bkr remove-account user1 user2
