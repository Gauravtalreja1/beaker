Pre-defined host filters for workflow commands
==============================================

A new option :option:`--host-filter <bkr --host-filter>` is available
for the workflow commands to specify a pre-defined host-filter. You
can use pre-defined host filters as a short-hand for complicated or
difficult to remember XML snippets. A number of such filters are
included and new host-filters can be added to override existing
definitions or add new ones.
