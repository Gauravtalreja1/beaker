Recipe progress bar shows segments in the right position
========================================================

Each task in a recipe is now represented by an individual segment in the 
progress bar, color-coded to indicate its result and with a link to the task's 
results. Previously the progress bar only showed an aggregate proportion for 
each result type in the recipe.
