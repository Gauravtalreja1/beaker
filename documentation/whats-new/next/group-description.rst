support group description
=========================

Beaker now supports group description. The group description can be managed by
using either `bkr-group-modify` or the web UI. The web UI for managing groups
has been changed. The `Root Passwowrd` tab has been introduced to display the
root password. The place where was used for the root password now shows the group
description.
