Beaker Usage Reminder
=====================

A new server side program ``beaker-usage-reminder`` (see :ref:`beaker-usage-reminder`)
is now available to send email reminders to users to keep track of their usage
of test systems.

Beaker administrators can setup a cron job on a Beaker server to send reminders
at regular intervals using this program.
