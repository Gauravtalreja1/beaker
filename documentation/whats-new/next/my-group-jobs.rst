My Group Jobs page
==================

Beaker 0.13 introduced the "group jobs" feature, which allows users to submit 
jobs for a specific group. As part of this feature, the "My Jobs" page was 
updated to also include jobs from other users which were submitted for a group 
of which you are a member.

However, this made the "My Jobs" page excessively noisy for users who belong to 
many groups. In this release the "My Jobs" page has been reverted to its 
previous behaviour, and a new "My Group Jobs" page has been introduced which 
lists jobs submitted for any groups of which you are a member.
