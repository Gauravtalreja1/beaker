bkr system-modify
=================

It is now possible to use the ``bkr system-modify`` command to change
the active access policy of a system. The ``--pool-policy`` option can
be used to change the active access policy of a system to a specified
system pool's policy and the ``--use-custom-policy`` switch can be
used to revert the active access policy to the system's custom policy.
