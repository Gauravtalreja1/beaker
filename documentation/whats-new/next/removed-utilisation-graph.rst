Utilisation graph removed
=========================

The utilisation graph (previously accessible by selecting 
:menuselection:`Reports --> Utilisation Graph` from the menu) has been removed 
in this version of Beaker. The graph was very expensive to render and was 
unusably slow on large Beaker installations. Beaker's :ref:`Graphite 
integration <graphite>` provides a faster, more flexible alternative for 
visualizing historical performance of a Beaker installation.
