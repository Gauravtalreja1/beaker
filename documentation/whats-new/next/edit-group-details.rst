Modify user group ("feature")
=============================

Beaker users can modify group details (group name, display name) and
change the group membership (add/remove group members) of the groups
they own.

A new sub-command ``bkr group-modify`` has been added to
modify the group details from the command line, in addition to the Web
UI. (Contributed by Amit Saha in :issue:`952978` and :issue:`908176`.)
