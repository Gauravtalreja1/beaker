Modify user group ("feature")
=============================

Beaker users can modify group details (group name, display name) and
change the group membership (add/remove group members) of the groups
they own. Users will get an email notification when their membership
changes (added/removed).

A new sub-command ``bkr group-modify`` has been added to
modify the group details from the command line, in addition to the Web
UI.
