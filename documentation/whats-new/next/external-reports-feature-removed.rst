External Reports feature removed
================================

The External Reports feature has been removed. Administrators who want to link 
to external reports (or any other resources hosted outside Beaker) should use 
the theming support to inject extra HTML into Beaker's web UI. Refer to 
:ref:`theming-custom-markup` for an example of injecting a site-specific link 
in the Help menu.
