What's New
==========

This document covers major changes to Beaker in each release. It is aimed
at users and administrators of existing Beaker installations that are
being upgraded to a new version.


.. For developers

   During the development cycle, just add new release notes as separate
   files in the appropriate release directory without worrying about
   the relative order. Once the release is declared feature complete
   and ready for formal testing, then wildcard entry will be replaced
   with an explicit list that puts the subsections in some kind of
   sensible order.


What's new in Beaker 1.0?
-------------------------

After more than 5 years of active development, Beaker is finally taking the
plunge and declaring a 1.0 release!

The primary new feature in Beaker 1.0 is the initial implementation of the
:ref:`proposal-enhanced-user-groups` design proposal.
